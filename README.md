# Password Strength Assessment Tool

This project is a tool designed to evaluate the strength of user-entered passwords. It analyzes various factors, such as length, complexity, and uniqueness, to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.

## Features

* Length Analysis: Ensures passwords meet minimum length requirements.

* Complexity Check: Evaluates if the password contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

* Uniqueness Verification: Identifies repetitive patterns, sequences, or common dictionary words.

* Real-Time Feedback: Offers suggestions to help users create stronger, more secure passwords.


## How It Works

The tool uses algorithms to evaluate passwords based on the following criteria:

1. Length: Passwords shorter than a recommended minimum are flagged as weak.


2. Character Diversity: Checks for uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and special characters.


3. Pattern Detection: Recognizes and flags common sequences or repeated characters.


4. Dictionary Matching: Detects passwords that include easily guessable words or phrases.



## Passwords are categorized as:

* Weak

* Good

* Fair



### Suggestions are provided for weak or moderate passwords to improve their strength.

# Benefits

* Security: Helps users create passwords resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.

* User-Friendly: Provides clear feedback and actionable suggestions.

* Customizable: Can be adapted to meet specific security policies.


# Use Cases

* Standalone Tool: Users can analyze and strengthen their passwords independently.

* Integration: Organizations can incorporate the tool into their applications or systems for password validation.
